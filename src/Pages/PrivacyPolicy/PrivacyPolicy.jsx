          <p>
            At Betterhalf, your privacy is our top priority. It is the core of
            the way we build the product you love, so that you can fully trust
            us and render your focus on building meaningful connections in
            search of your life partner.
          </p>
          <p>
            We appreciate the trust you have put in us when you provide us with
            your personal information and we surely do not take that for
            granted.
          </p>
          <p>
            We promise not to compromise with your privacy.​ We have designed
            our product keeping your privacy in mind. With the amalgamation of
            various experts in the fields of legal, security, engineering, and
            product design, we make sure that no decision related to your
            privacy is taken without your consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to be transparent while processing your data.​ We
            understand that insufficient information and overly complicated
            language are common issues in companies’ privacy policies. So, as a
            result, we have taken a different approach: we have formulated our
            Privacy Policy and other documentation in much simpler language;
            just to give you a better and a clear picture of our practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            We make sure your personal information is secure.​ We have allotted
            different teams to keep your data safe and secure. We constantly
            update our security to enhance the safety of your personal
            information. So, be assured, your data is in safe hands!
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not recommend to share your contact number or bank account
            details unless you wish to do so.
